Here’s a breakdown of the major features introduced in each Java version from Java 8 to Java 17, with a primary focus on Java 8, Java 12, Java 15, and Java 17.

Java 8 (2014) – A Major Release
	1.	Lambda Expressions – Enables functional programming.

	3.	Streams API – Process collections in a functional way.
	4.	Default & Static Methods in Interfaces – Allows methods with implementations inside interfaces.
	5.	Optional Class – Avoids NullPointerException by providing a container for nullable objects.
	6.	New Date-Time API (java.time package) – More robust and flexible than java.util.Date.
	7.	Collectors & Method References – Easier way to manipulate collections and reference methods.
	8.	Parallel Sort – Faster sorting using parallelism.
	9.	JavaScript Engine (Nashorn) – Allows embedding JavaScript in Java.
	10.	Base64 Encoding and Decoding API – java.util.Base64 for encoding/decoding.

Java 9 (2017)
	1.	Project Jigsaw (Module System) – Enables modularization of Java applications.
	2.	JShell (REPL) – Interactive Java shell for quick testing.
	3.	Private Methods in Interfaces – Allows encapsulation in interfaces.
	4.	Compact Strings – Optimizes memory usage for String storage.
	5.	Improved Stream API – New methods like takeWhile(), dropWhile(), and iterate().
	6.	Try-With-Resources Enhancement – Auto-closeable resources can be final or effectively final.
	7.	Factory Methods for Collections – List.of(), Set.of(), Map.of().
	8.	Process API Enhancements – More control over system processes.

Java 10 (2018)
	1.	var (Local-Variable Type Inference) – Automatically infers the variable type.
	2.	G1 Garbage Collector Improvements – Better performance.
	3.	Application Class-Data Sharing (AppCDS) – Improves startup performance.

Java 11 (2018) – LTS Release
	1.	Removed Java EE & CORBA Modules – Streamlines JDK.
	2.	New HTTP Client (java.net.http) – Replaces HttpURLConnection.
	3.	String Methods – isBlank(), lines(), strip(), repeat().
	4.	Files API Enhancements – Files.writeString(), Files.readString().
	5.	Launch Single-File Source Code – No need to compile separately.

Java 12 (2019)
	1.	Switch Expressions (Preview) – More readable switch statements.
	2.	Shenandoah GC – Low-latency garbage collection.
	3.	Compact Number Formatting – Formats numbers like “1K” instead of “1000”.
	4.	JVM Constants API – Improves handling of constants.

Java 13 (2019)
	1.	Text Blocks (Preview) – Multi-line strings using """.
	2.	Switch Expressions (2nd Preview) – Further refinements.
	3.	Reimplemented Legacy Socket API – Improves performance.

Java 14 (2020)
	1.	Records (Preview) – Concise data classes (record Person(String name, int age) {}).
	2.	Pattern Matching for instanceof (Preview) – Simplifies type checks.
	3.	Helpful NullPointerException Messages – More informative stack traces.
	4.	Switch Expressions (Finalized) – Fully introduced.

Java 15 (2020)
	1.	Text Blocks (Finalized) – Multi-line strings are officially supported.
	2.	Sealed Classes (Preview) – Restricts which classes can extend a class.
	3.	Hidden Classes – Useful for frameworks generating classes dynamically.
	4.	ZGC Enhancements – Low-latency garbage collection for large heaps.
	5.	Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) – Enhanced cryptographic support.

Java 16 (2021)
	1.	Records (Finalized) – Eliminates boilerplate in data classes.
	2.	Pattern Matching for instanceof (Finalized) – More concise type checks.
	3.	Strongly Encapsulated JDK Internals – Strengthens security.
	4.	Unix-Domain Socket Support – Adds inter-process communication.

Java 17 (2021) – LTS Release
	1.	Sealed Classes (Finalized) – Controls inheritance hierarchy.
	2.	Pattern Matching for switch (Preview) – More concise switch statements.
	3.	New macOS Rendering Pipeline – Uses Metal instead of OpenGL.
	4.	Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator) – Better interaction with native code.
	5.	Deprecation of Security Manager – Plans to remove it in future versions.
	6.	Removed RMI Activation System – Cleans up outdated features.

Summary of Key Versions:
	•	Java 8 – Introduced Lambda, Streams, Functional Interfaces.
	•	Java 12 – Switch Expressions, Shenandoah GC.
	•	Java 15 – Text Blocks, Sealed Classes, Hidden Classes.
	•	Java 17 – Sealed Classes, Pattern Matching for switch, Foreign Function API (LTS).
