We are using the Editable TableUI kit with a multi-select dropdown. However, we need to populate the dropdown data based on the currently selected row. This means the data displayed in the dropdown varies for each row. To achieve this, we need to make an API call using the User ID of the selected row, fetch the relevant data, and display it in the dropdown. Currently, we do not see an option to pass the User ID to the allItems$() method.
