I am really very confused how to start preparation to my interviews that cover all the in my tech stack also new tech skills
I am a full stack Java developer with UI technologies like both Angular and ReactJS 

So I want to learn new as well as revise all the techniques 

Can you prepare my time table considering my tech stack?
